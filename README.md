# NASA Solar Flares Endpoint Test

This repository contains code to fetch NASA's endpoint for solar flares

## Pre-requisites

Download and set up [Lune](https://github.com/lune-org/lune)

Sign up for an API key for [NASA](https://api.nasa.gov) and add it to your `.env` file

## Usage

In `/lib/`, there will be libraries for fetching API endpoints.

To run an example script, open a terminal and run it using Lune:

```sh
lune run ./example.luau
```
